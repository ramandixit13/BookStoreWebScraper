# BookStoreWebScraper
Bookstore Web Scraper This notebook is a practice exercise in web scraping. It can scrape data from selected pages of http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/.  The user needs to provide a base url (http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/ in this case) and pages to scrape.  The function will return a Pandas dataframe of the scraped data (Rating, Book Name, Price of Book, In Stock)
